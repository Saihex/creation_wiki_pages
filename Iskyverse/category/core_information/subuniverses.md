To understand how **Iskyverse subuniverses** work, we first need to understand how a [Venn Diagram](https://byjus.com/maths/venn-diagrams/) functions.

The entire Iskyverse is equivalent to the **universal set** in a Venn Diagram, while the subuniverses are the **subsets**.

The core idea is that each subuniverse has its own set of physical constants and properties. For example, **Subuniverse B** might have gravity that pulls **upward**, whereas others have gravity that pulls **downward**.

This kind of difference is referred to as **External Physical Properties**—meaning the physics that govern a universe externally. If an object from Subuniverse B exits its native universe (which is possible, thanks to the physical properties granted by Isky), it must obey the physical rules of whatever universe it enters.

## 🚪 Exiting a Subuniverse

Even quantum physics isn’t enough to bypass a subuniverse's boundary. To exit a subuniverse, a special kind of physical attribute is required—called **magic**, duh. Only a select few subuniverses have been granted magic, such as [The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris/).

So far, **only Isky** can freely exit any subuniverse and exist in **The Between**—the void that represents the universal set. Nothing else can exist there without its physical properties collapsing into nonexistence.

## ⚠️ Isky's Limited Control

Despite her godlike abilities, Isky doesn’t have full control over her subuniverses. Once she creates one, all she can do is watch it evolve. She cannot influence its development or modify its physical laws after creation.

Though she can enter subuniverses and use her magical abilities, she must follow a strict rule: **"Do not interfere too much."** If she uses her powers excessively, the subuniverse could collapse—destroying itself and everything within it.

## 🌌 Subuniverse Physical Laws: *Isky's Subuniverse Law*

During the early days of creation, **Isky** observed certain patterns and behaviors within her subuniverses—phenomena that remained consistent and could not be altered, no matter her power or intent. These immutable behaviors led her to define a foundational set of principles known as **Isky's Subuniverse Law (ISL)**.

Each law in the ISL describes how subuniverses behave on a fundamental level, ensuring balance and continuity across the entire Iskyverse.

<summary>🌀 <strong>Negentropy of Energy</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Negentropy of Energy**  
> *"For every amount of energy that exits a subuniverse, an equal amount of energy from the destination subuniverse will instantaneously and permanently be transferred into the source subuniverse."*

This law ensures the **permanent conservation of energy across subuniverses**. When an object—whether animate or inanimate—travels from **Subuniverse A to Subuniverse B**, it carries its inherent energy (mass-energy, momentum, magical essence, etc.) with it. This results in an energy loss in Sub A and a gain in Sub B.

To counteract this imbalance, the **Negentropy of Energy** activates, causing **Subuniverse B to transfer an equal amount of its own energy back into Sub A**. This compensation is:
- **Instantaneous**, preventing destabilization,
- **Permanent**, remaining even if the object never returns,
- And **automatic**, embedded into the fabric of Iskyverse reality itself.

Over time, this law can lead to **gradual shifts** in subuniversal energy density if cross-subuniverse travel is frequent in one direction. Subuniverses may grow **denser, hotter, or more volatile** depending on the flow of matter and energy between them.

Negentropy of Energy reflects the Iskyverse's underlying preference for **cosmic parity**—a deep law of symmetry, flow, and conservation that keeps all subsets tethered to a greater balance.
