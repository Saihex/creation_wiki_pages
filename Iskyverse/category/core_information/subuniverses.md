# Subuniverses

To understand how **Iskyverse subuniverses** work, we first need to understand how a [Venn Diagram](https://byjus.com/maths/venn-diagrams/) functions.

The entire Iskyverse is equivalent to the **universal set** in a Venn Diagram, while the subuniverses are the **subsets**.

The core idea is that each subuniverse has its own set of physical constants and properties. For example, **Subuniverse B** might have gravity that pulls **upward**, whereas others have gravity that pulls **downward**.

This kind of difference is referred to as **External Physical Properties**—meaning the physics that govern a universe externally. If an object from Subuniverse B exits its native universe (which is possible, thanks to the physical properties granted by Isky), it must obey the physical rules of whatever universe it enters.

## Exiting a Subuniverse

Even quantum physics isn’t enough to bypass a subuniverse's boundary. To exit a subuniverse, a special kind of physical attribute is required—called **magic**, duh. Only a select few subuniverses have been granted magic, such as [The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris/).

So far, **only Isky** can freely exit any subuniverse and exist in **The Between**—the void that represents the universal set. Nothing else can exist there without its physical properties collapsing into nonexistence.

## Isky's Limited Control

Despite her godlike abilities, Isky doesn’t have full control over her subuniverses. Once she creates one, all she can do is watch it evolve. She cannot influence its development or modify its physical laws after creation.

Though she can enter subuniverses and use her magical abilities, she must follow a strict rule: **"Do not interfere too much."** If she uses her powers excessively, the subuniverse could collapse—destroying itself and everything within it.
