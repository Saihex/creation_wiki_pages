To understand how **Iskyverse subuniverses** work, we first need to understand how a [Venn Diagram](https://byjus.com/maths/venn-diagrams/) functions.

The entire Iskyverse is equivalent to the **universal set** in a Venn Diagram, while the subuniverses are the **subsets**.

The core idea is that each subuniverse has its own set of physical constants and properties. For example, **Subuniverse B** might have gravity that pulls **upward**, whereas others have gravity that pulls **downward**.

This kind of difference is referred to as **External Physical Properties**‚Äîmeaning the physics that govern a universe externally. If an object from Subuniverse B exits its native universe (which is possible, thanks to the physical properties granted by Isky), it must obey the physical rules of whatever universe it enters.

## üö™ Exiting a Subuniverse

Even quantum physics isn‚Äôt enough to bypass a subuniverse's boundary. To exit a subuniverse, a special kind of physical attribute is required‚Äîcalled **magic**, duh. Only a select few subuniverses have been granted magic, such as [The 4Tris](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/The4Tris/).

So far, **only Isky** can freely exit any subuniverse and exist in **The Between**‚Äîthe void that represents the universal set. Nothing else can exist there without its physical properties collapsing into nonexistence.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Isky's Limited Control

Despite her godlike abilities, Isky doesn‚Äôt have full control over her subuniverses. Once she creates one, all she can do is watch it evolve. She cannot influence its development or modify its physical laws after creation.

Though she can enter subuniverses and use her magical abilities, she must follow a strict rule: **"Do not interfere too much."** If she uses her powers excessively, the subuniverse could collapse‚Äîdestroying itself and everything within it.

## üåå Subuniverse Physical Laws: Isky's Subuniverse Law

During the early days of creation, **Isky** observed certain patterns and behaviors within her subuniverses‚Äîphenomena that remained consistent and could not be altered, no matter her power or intent. These immutable behaviors led her to define a foundational set of principles known as **Isky's Subuniverse Law (ISL)**.

Each law in the ISL describes how subuniverses behave on a fundamental level, ensuring balance and continuity across the entire Iskyverse.

<summary>üåÄ <strong>Negentropy of Energy</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Negentropy of Energy**  
> *"For every amount of energy that exits a subuniverse, an equal amount of energy from the destination subuniverse will instantaneously and permanently be transferred into the source subuniverse."*

This law ensures the **permanent conservation of energy across subuniverses**. When an object‚Äîwhether animate or inanimate‚Äîtravels from **Subuniverse A to Subuniverse B**, it carries its inherent energy (mass-energy, momentum, magical essence, etc.) with it. This results in an energy loss in Sub A and a gain in Sub B.

To counteract this imbalance, the **Negentropy of Energy** activates, causing **Subuniverse B to transfer an equal amount of its own energy back into Sub A**. This compensation is:
- **Instantaneous**, preventing destabilization,
- **Permanent**, remaining even if the object never returns,
- And **automatic**, embedded into the fabric of Iskyverse reality itself.

Over time, this law can lead to **gradual shifts** in subuniversal energy density if cross-subuniverse travel is frequent in one direction. Subuniverses may grow **denser, hotter, or more volatile** depending on the flow of matter and energy between them.

Negentropy of Energy reflects the Iskyverse's underlying preference for **cosmic parity**‚Äîa deep law of symmetry, flow, and conservation that keeps all subsets tethered to a greater balance.

<summary>üî• <strong>Linked Destruction</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Linked Destruction**  
> *"If a parent subuniverse is destroyed, all matter and energy that originated from it‚Äîregardless of their current location in other subuniverses‚Äîare simultaneously destroyed. The compensatory energy that maintained their existence outside the parent universe is returned to the subuniverse where they currently reside."*

This law governs the deep connection between objects and their **origin subuniverse**, enforcing a **cosmic tether** that cannot be severed.

Even if an object currently exists far away in **Subuniverse B**, its fate remains bound to its **parent subuniverse A**. Should Sub A collapse or be destroyed‚Äîwhether due to excessive interference by Isky or catastrophic cosmic events‚Äîthe object itself will **cease to exist immediately**.

The energy that was transferred to Sub B to compensate for the object's existence (per the **Negentropy of Energy**) is then **returned back to Sub B** upon the object's destruction, restoring energy balance.

This law introduces a profound vulnerability: no matter how far matter or magic travel, their **existence is ultimately tied to their origin**. Destroying a subuniverse acts like pulling a cosmic leash, snapping the thread that holds its scattered fragments together.

<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è <strong>Atomic Discontinuity Law</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Atomic Discontinuity Law**  
> *"Due to the nature of Negentropy of Energy, any portal or tunnel-like path between subuniverses is inherently unsafe. Attempting to transport an object through such a method severs the atomic bonds of the object, resulting in its fragmentation upon arrival."*

This law reveals the fragile nature of matter and energy when subjected to **non-continuous transitions** across subuniverses.

When an object attempts to travel via a portal or tunnel‚Äîessentially a shortcut rather than a full transition‚Äîthe inherent physical and energetic stresses cause the **severance of atomic bonds**, breaking the object into constituent particles or fragments upon reaching its destination.

The **safest and most stable** method of travel between subuniverses is a **whole-object transition**, preserving its physical integrity and coherence.

Violating this principle results in the object **arriving as disassembled matter**, often useless or dangerous, emphasizing the importance of respecting the structure of energy flow dictated by Iskyverse laws.

<summary>‚ú® <strong>Arcane Invalidation Rule</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Arcane Invalidation Rule**  
> *"When a magical object travels from its origin subuniverse into another subuniverse that lacks magic, its magical power is diminished or rendered entirely unusable. The exact mechanism governing this effect remains unknown."*

This law highlights a fundamental limitation of magic within the Iskyverse: **magic is inherently tied to the subuniverse where it originates.**

Magical forces, energies, and effects that defy scientific explanation lose potency or cease to function altogether when crossing into magic-devoid subuniverses. However, **anomalous objects**‚Äîthose whose properties arise from unknown or non-magical origins‚Äîare unaffected by this rule.

Notably, **Isky herself is exempt from this law**. Her magical abilities remain fully functional across all subuniverses, regardless of their native magical status. Even Isky does not understand why she alone possesses this immunity, adding to her enigmatic nature.

The **Arcane Invalidation Rule** enforces a natural boundary between subuniverses based on the presence or absence of magic, preserving the uniqueness and integrity of each realm's physical and metaphysical laws.

<summary>üï≥Ô∏è <strong>Void Reversion Principle</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Void Reversion Principle**  
> *"When matter or energy originating from a subuniverse enters The Between‚Äîthe void representing the universal set‚Äîit ceases to exist in physical form. The nullified matter and energy are instantaneously converted and returned as pure energy to their origin subuniverse."*

This law governs the fate of all objects or energies that cross into **The Between**, where physical existence cannot be sustained.

Upon entering The Between, the object‚Äôs physical form collapses into nonexistence. However, to preserve cosmic balance and energy conservation, the object's mass-energy equivalence is immediately converted and **transferred back to its origin subuniverse as pure energy**.

This ensures that no energy is lost in the universal system, maintaining the integrity of the Iskyverse‚Äôs total energy and matter budget.

The **Void Reversion Principle** highlights the paradoxical nature of The Between as both a boundary and a recycling node within the multiverse structure.

<summary>üí• <strong>Cataclysmic Return Law</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Cataclysmic Return Law**  
> *"If an object originating from one subuniverse exists within a different subuniverse that undergoes collapse, the object is destroyed along with the host subuniverse. Its entire mass and energy are converted into pure energy and returned to its origin subuniverse."*

This law defines the consequences of a subuniverse's collapse on **foreign objects**‚Äîthose that do not originate from within.

If an object from **Subuniverse A** resides within **Subuniverse B**, and Sub B collapses (due to internal decay, external influence, or Isky‚Äôs interference), the foreign object cannot escape. It is **annihilated alongside the host subuniverse**.

However, rather than vanishing into nothingness, the object‚Äôs **mass-energy is fully recovered and redirected** to its **origin subuniverse**. This ensures continued energy conservation across the Iskyverse.

The **Cataclysmic Return Law** guarantees that **foreign matter always returns home in some form**, even if that return is triggered by cataclysmic ends.

<summary>üåå <strong>Negentropy of Balance</strong></summary>

**Isky's Subuniverse Law: Negentropy of Balance**  
> *"When the matter-energy ratio of a subuniverse becomes critically imbalanced due to inter-subuniversal energy transfers, excess energy is automatically transmuted into hydrogen atoms to restore equilibrium."*

This law acts as a *cosmic regulator*, counterbalancing the effects of laws like the **Void Reversion Principle** and **Negentropy of Energy**, which may cause excessive energy buildup in a subuniverse without an equivalent increase in mass.

If a subuniverse‚Äôs **mass-to-energy ratio drops below a critical threshold**, the law activates:
- **Pure energy** is converted into **hydrogen atoms**, the simplest and most stable form of matter.
- This process is **irreversible by natural subuniversal means**, anchoring the energy permanently.

However, NoB will **not activate** in response to:
- Black holes consuming matter,
- Star formation or destruction,
- Technological or biological activity from inside the subuniverse.

These are considered **self-originating processes**, not subject to external rebalancing rules.

**Hydrogen transmuted by NoB can be re-converted into energy**, but only through:
- **Antimatter collisions**, resulting in total annihilation and energy release.
- **Black hole evaporation** via **Hawking radiation**, slowly returning mass to energy.

This law ensures that **interdimensional imbalance does not cause runaway energy inflation**, allowing subuniverses to retain structure, avoid instability, and possibly even evolve into new forms.

...unless, naturally, the local civilizations decide to ruin everything the old-fashioned way‚Äî**by being catastrophically stupid.**
