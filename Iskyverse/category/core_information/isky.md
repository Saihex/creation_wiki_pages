See Isky's origin story to better understand her beginnings: [Isky](../universe_wide_stories/isky)

**Isky** is the first entity to exist in the **Iskyverse**, residing in her own subuniverse known as the **Iskyverse Center**. She possesses the power of creation, along with various magical abilities, treating the entire Iskyverse as her personal sandbox.

However, much like in actual sandbox games, **there are rules she must follow**. She cannot interfere too much with any subuniverse (except Iskyverse Center), or its very existence could collapse. Because of this, she mostly stays within the Iskyverse Center, occasionally visiting the subuniverses she’s created.

Originally, Isky was a sentient, floating magical orb. She had no memory of who she was or what her purpose might be. Still, she found immense joy in creating new universes and watching them evolve—especially with all her quirky and unrealistic physical laws.

## Isky's Forms

Isky has two forms: one as a **magical floating orb**, and another as a **feline-like anthropomorphic body**. She prefers using her feline form for daily "life" and when visiting her creations. However, she still shifts into her magical orb form whenever she needs to stay hidden—or just feels like floating around incognito.
