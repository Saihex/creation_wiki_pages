**Canon Alignment Type**, also known as **CAT**, is a classification system used in the **Iskyverse** to determine whether a piece of content—such as films or games—created by [IskandarAlex2](https://iskandaralex2.carrd.co/) or other creators, aligns with the official canon.

There are three CAT categories: **Canon**, **Gapfill**, and **Diversion**.

Only [IskandarAlex2](https://iskandaralex2.carrd.co/) can assign a work as Canon or Gapfill, as she is the sole controller of the Iskyverse.

## Canon Alignment Type: Canon (CAT-1)

**Canon Alignment Type: Canon** or **CAT-1** indicates that a piece of content is **essential** to the franchise's main storyline and timeline. 

All content under this type must be rated **Teen (13+)** to ensure that younger audiences can follow the core narrative without missing key elements or becoming confused.

## Canon Alignment Type: Gapfill (CAT-2)

<img alt="CAT-2 Symbol" align="right" width="300" src="https://s3.saihex.com/wiki-assets/Iskyverse/CanonAlignmentTypes/CAT-2.svg">

**Canon Alignment Type: Gapfill** or **CAT-2** designates content that still fits within the storyline and timeline of the franchise, but is **not essential** for understanding the main plot.

This label is often used for side stories, like **“A Day in Isky’s Life”**—canon, but not required viewing.

Content under this type can be rated **Teen (13+)** or **Mature (17+)**, as missing it won't negatively impact younger viewers' understanding of the core narrative.

## Canon Alignment Type: Diversion (CAT-3)

<img alt="CAT-3 Symbol" align="right" width="300" src="https://s3.saihex.com/wiki-assets/Iskyverse/CanonAlignmentTypes/CAT-3.svg">

**Canon Alignment Type: Diversion** or **CAT-3** refers to **non-canon** content. These may diverge from a certain point in the main timeline—similar to a [Git fork](https://www.theserverside.com/blog/Coffee-Talk-Java-News-Stories-and-Opinions/command-line-GitHub-fork-CLI-terminal-shell).

This category **must** be used for fan fiction and clearly labeled to avoid confusion.

Content under this type can be anything rated **Teen (13+)** or older. However, **no children's content is allowed** under this category for any Iskyverse franchise, due to the existence of potentially mature Gapfill content that might conflict with child-safe expectations.
