The short story is written by Isky in her first writing you can get here: [Isky.pdf](https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/Iskyverse/pdf/Isky.pdf)

**Isky** is a sentient magical orb that awakens in an endless, empty field with no memory of its origin or purpose.

After an eternal search for meaning, it discovers its ability to shape reality through imagination — creating a portal, then a singularity that births an entire universe.

As time passes and life evolves in this new realm, the orb transforms into a feline-like anthropomorphic being named **Isky**, to interact with her creations more personally. She continues to craft multiple **"subuniverses"** within the greater **Iskyverse**, each with its own unique laws. Though curious about dimensions beyond, she finds comfort and joy in nurturing the lives she’s brought into existence.
