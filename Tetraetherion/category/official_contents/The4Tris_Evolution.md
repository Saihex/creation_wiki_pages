The 4Tris is Tetraetherion™'s former name before rebranding.
This page will still refer to Tetraetherion™ as "The 4Tris" to respect timeline naming.

# The 4Tris' Evolution
The 4Tris begins with [Sairo Darling](../Characters/Sairo). Her name was firstly spelled `SAIRo` as abbreviation for **Smart Artificial Intelligence Robot** and yes she started as an AI Robot rather than [BCR](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot) that she currently is.

## Franchise Generation Evolution

**The 4Tris** has gone two generations so far. The franchise was created around the same time between **Sairo V2 and V3**.

### The 4Tris - First Generation

**The 4Tris First Generation** logo is a simple diamond split into four, each piece featuring a unique abstract pattern. It was created by [IskandarAlex2](https://iskandaralex2.carrd.co/) back in **2023**, during the early formation of the franchise.

Just like many of IskandarAlex2's earlier creations, **The 4Tris First Generation** logo has several technical issues. The polygons were not merged properly, resulting in awkward gaps between each piece, which become more pronounced when zoomed in.

Moreover, the first-generation logo did not reflect the franchise's content at all. It’s as if you saw an artwork titled *"Transcend"*—only to find a plain diamond sitting in the middle of a room.

### The 4Tris - Second Generation

<img alt="The 4Tris Logo with Text V2" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/The4Tris_Cover_Text.svg">

**The 4Tris Second Generation** logo is much more complex compared to the first generation. It consists of zodiac-like symbols representing the four main characters of the franchise, alongside the [Iskyverse](https://wiki.saihex.com/wiki/Iskyverse) logo. This logo was also created by [IskandarAlex2](https://iskandaralex2.carrd.co/) on `June 4th, 2025`, and was released publicly the following day.

This generation was developed in parallel with the creation of **Sairo V5**.

## Sairo's Evolution

[Sairo Darling](../Characters/Sairo) went through multiple iterations and was created as early as when Saihex Studios was **Starsdust Studios**.

Sairo was an taken from [IskandarAlex2's](https://iskandaralex2.carrd.co/) old creation ***SAIBots*** which under her [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com) Sci-Fi franchise **"I.S.K Inc"** which we already abandoned before we even thought of making `SAIRo`

### Sairo V1

<img alt="Sairo V1" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/official_contents/sairo/sairo_v1.png">

<img alt="SaiSword V1" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/official_contents/sairo/sword_v1.png">

**Sairo V1** was designed by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) back in `24th November 2022`. Her body is detached and held together by strong electromagnets. She doesn't have any hands and her face is entirely static images with no procedural graphics. The simple design both visual and technical was because of Isk's knowledge limit of barely knowing proper weight painting, texture baking, shader math, etc.

This version was created for **SAIRo** game which has been cancelled long ago. Although, four musics for it was already composed by [Vandoorea](https://www.youtube.com/@Vandoorea) that can be found in a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNVE8lNMMe2GBo_4RDFaTb44uB-nv5cDK). These musics are planned to be used in [The 4Tris: Unreal](../official_contents/The4Tris_Unreal) as a form of gratitude for contributing with us.

This version of Sairo did not get any other changes since creation until replaced with [Sairo V2](#sairo-v2-and-v3) sometime later after its creation.

### Sairo V2 and V3

<img alt="Sairo V3" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/official_contents/sairo/sairo_v3.png">
<img alt="Sairo V2 with Spectra V1" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/official_contents/sairo/sairo_v2.png">

**V1 image contains [Spectra Interno](../Characters/Spectra) V1 which won't be discussed.**

**V3 contains [SaiSword](../Characters/Sairo#saisword) V2.**

**V3 second image contains [SaiSword](../Characters/Sairo#saisword) V3.**

**Sairo V2** and **Sairo V3** was designed by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) back in `2023` around `February` and `March` as **V2** did not last long being visually unpleasant to us. Her body is connected by electromagnet ball-socket joints. Simple procedural shader is already implemented on her face for eyes. The rise of dual color design came up on `V3` with an uneven distribution around her body.

Around **V3** times, it has gone multiple small changes that we are not able to keep track of because back then we do not keep our actions in proper records. Due to this, any version of Sairo where she have **blocky arms and legs** as well **dual-color** are considered **V3**.

### Sairo V4
<img alt="SaiSword V3" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/characters/sairo/sairo_saisword.png">
<img alt="Sairo V4" align="right" width="172" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/characters/sairo/sairo.png">

**Sairo V4** was designed by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) back in early `2024`. Anatomy design is explained in [BCR page](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot). We decided to use **smooth arm and legs** to make her look more appealing and use more female-ly waist design as well chest to better explain her personality in visual form. No more major changes are planned so this version would be the last for now.

Sairo V4 designed was based of [Silica's](../Characters/Silica) original design where she have **smooth arm and legs** unlike Sairo because she is designed for mechanic work meaning flexible arm and legs would really be helpful for her in small spaces.
After a while, we decided to implement the **smooth arm and legs** design to [Brain Crystal Robot](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot) because the design just looks more appealing and pleasing to our eyes.

<u>Sub-changes</u>
1. `v4.1` (30th Oct 2024): Added physical mouth and tongue. This is also followed by the other 3 main characters upgrading them to v`*.1`.
   - [Spectra Interno](../Characters/Spectra): `v3.1`
   - [Silica Darling](../Characters/Silica): `v1.1`
   - [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno): `v1.1`
