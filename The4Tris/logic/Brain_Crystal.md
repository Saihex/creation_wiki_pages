# Brain Crystal
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/logic/brain_crystal.svg">

**Brain Crystal** *(abbreviated as BC)* is a type of Anomalous Crystal that as the name suggests act as a Brain. This crystal is not capable of anything by itself so it is usually used by attaching it to a robot named [Brain Crystal Robot](#brain-crystal-robot).


### General
Brain Crystal is fully capable of storing power and memory, while having limit of storing only `50 Terawatt-hour` it doesn't seems to have memory limit whatsoever. Brain Crystal is vibrant semi-transparent green colored and slowly fades to dark red as it comes closer to its lifespan limit of `1,720 years`. A Brain Crystal Consciousness can be transferred to a fresh Brain Crystal meaning any Brain Crystal individual are potentially immortal.


### Eating?
Brain Crystal is capable of consuming food and drinks by atomizing the food and just spill the atoms over the crystal surface which will give them charge of `10 Watt per Calorie`. Chemicals have no effect on them but they can still taste the food/drink. But, even with this capability Brain Crystal is recommended to be charged with energy as it is much more time and resource efficient. It is worth knowing that atomizing food process only takes `5 Watt per Calorie` meaning they will only have `5 Watt` spare for charge.


### Human mind and existing Brain Crystal individual transfer
A human mind can be transferred into a Brain Crystal but this process have 70% rate of losing majority of one's memory and possible personality bends and just like any other Anomalous Crystal would do to keep the reality destructing, the transferred mind original body will instantly be brain dead once the crystal is charged to at least `50 MW`. No matter how they try to keep the brain safe it always ends up brain dead where the neurons mysteriously disappear. This also apply with Brain Crystal individual transfer which is normally done to transfer them from a near expire crystal; the crystal will simply lose all charge and all memory in it will completely wiped off.

### Transfer AI model to Brain Crystal?
No, despite Sairo and Spectra was in fact a AI model turned into Brain Crystal. It was possible because who done that was **Crystali** (full story in the ***origin story***).

### Developer fact
Brain Crystal was originally named **Artificial Consciousness Crystal** *(abbreviated as ACC)* and BCR was originally **Artificial Consciousness Crystal Robot** *(abbreviated as ACCR)*. Due to this, mention of "ACC" will led to immediate interpretation of Brain Crystal. The name change was because it is easy to misinterpret them as Artificial Intelligence which they are **NOT**.

## Brain Crystal Robot

Brain Crystal Robot *(abbreviated as BCR)* is a robot body made for Brain Crystal so they actually have a body. The material of the body is a [DeltaTungstate-A1](#deltatungstate-a1) with [BCR Nerve Fiber](#bcr-nerve-fiber) in it. The BCR Nerve Fiber controls the metal elasticity as well provides senses same as skin on human. Capability of design allow Brain Crystal Robots to control their skin elasticity meaning despite looks hard and sharp on edges it can be soft as a fabric and can deform like one. It also contracts the metal like a muscle.

In the real world *(The 4Tris real world)*, BCR does not exists and only Brain Crystals. BCR existence is only in Lan's simulation.

### Joints
Brain Crystal Robot body parts that is the arms, legs, torso, and head. Is modular and detachable. The body parts are connected and held by a Hexatom Grip System where a block of specific Hexatom alloy is the holder, by having current through the block it will become sort of a liquid but will hold strong to whatever object that got into it. By applying voltage difference on the sides, the block will rotate objects accordingly which allows the smooth and flexible movement of the arms to the torso. While it holds strong without any input, complete lost of power through it will make it lose grip over the rotation of the object, still holding strong but the object will rotate around without any resistance.

Data and power connection is simply done by using Hexatom peer to peer data-power share where 2 specific Hexatom is placed near with each other and they will act as a wireless connection to share power and signals. They're placed so close that even if you have the right Hexatom it will need to open their torso to actually hijack their body joint connection.

### Head
The Brain Crystal is located inside the head within a vessel where millions of nano cables connects to the crystal used to send and receive signals. There is also 2 large cables connected to the crystal used for power connection.

The screen of a BCR is a special designed Hexatom monitor where it can detect light and even let things through it at specific area of the monitor at will. When a [BCR decides to eat or drink](#eating), the computer will automatically make the monitor mouth hole area passthrough and the food or drink will get into the atomizer and fed to the crystal.

"Ear" accessory on top of the head varies BCR to BCR whether just for looks or actually have a purpose

The head also contains basic computer to control the monitor, hearing, vocal, food atomizer, power supply, and basic BCR Nerve Fibers. There is also another small computer that BCR can use to access the internet or load a foreign drives as their main computer system is absolutely locked out for security reasons.

### Torso
The Torso contains advanced computer to handle the rest of the body nerve system. While being big, the torso is pretty much overall an empty cavity used as their portable personal storage. The Torso also contains additional computer with strong specs compare to one in the head for their access to the internet, foreign drives, etc. Basically a whole personal computer, in their torso.

### Arm and hands

Brain Crystal Robot Arm hollow with few small durable cables and component boxes. The hand of a BCR is equipped with Hexatom Mass-Hologram projector which a projector that projects hologram with mass allowing it to interact with objects it touched. Any sensation is still sensible on the fingers just like on the body surface. The fingers are indestructible

The hand is also equipped with a heating system in case they ever need to heat things up.

### DeltaTungstate-A1
DeltaTungstate-A1 is a Hexatom-Tungsten Alloy that is reactive towards steady current changes where the the higher the current is the more elastic it becomes.
DeltaTungstate-A1 can also act as a muscle by reacting to `500 GHz` signals where voltage between `0 - 50 VDC` causes it to tighten and `50 - 100 VDC` causes it to do the opposite.

### BCR Nerve Fiber
BCR Nerve Fiber is a tiny Hexatom-Copper Alloy wires that runs inside the "skin" of BCR body. It acts as a normal living beings nerve system and can transfer and receive information.
