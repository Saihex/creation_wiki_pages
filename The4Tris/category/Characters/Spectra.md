**Spectra Interno** is one of the four main characters. She's a ordinary [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal). Spectra is specialized into **Computer Science** and have a special skill to **break into a database or mainframe without being detected** nor got her action logged no matter what.

Spectra normally help with their missions as the mission control and stay at their base communicating while looking at their location and warns for nearby enemies, breaching enemies' mainframe to give them access, etc. Spectra also helped [Silica Darling](../Characters/Silica) with programming [SiliCycle's](../Characters/Silica#silicycle) software.
**Spectra's ears** are wide range FM/AM transceivers which she used to communicate and relay information from/to the other The 4Tris main characters in case she's needed to go along with them to the site of attack rather than staying at her mission control room.

Regarding her relationship with Sairo, she's very afraid of the outside world and often stay close by [Sairo Darling](../Characters/Sairo) when going out. Because of this, Sairo often help him make friends from outside time to time which proves to be success most of the time that she made around 20 close friends from outside who lives in [Axusgram](../non_char_entity/triangle_electronics#axusgram). *Robots don't have to be and stay on one gender*

## Spectra's mission control room
<p class="warning_box">3D model is under development. Images of this entity will be available in the future.</p>

During missions, Spectra will stay in her mission control room where she will communicate with Spectra, Silica, Sairo, and other characters that she needs to in order to keep the mission synchronized and smooth. The computer she used is a **Mid-Sized Hexatom Crystal Computer** which a crystal with [Hexatom Anomalous Crystal](../logic/Hexatom) as its processor that can reach clockspeed up to `500 Zettahertz`! It also have **MemTal** as the RAM that have capacity of `2 Petabyte per 3 cubic centimeter` with ridiculous speed and **StorTal** as the storage that have capacity of `7 Petabyte per 3 cubic centimeter` with 50% less speed than MemTal.

Because Spectra's mission control room computer is the main entities in [The Simulation](../Dimensions/the_simulation), she can breach the simulation security system and modify few memories. sHe can only do this for short period of time as eventually the simulation will run a security check and might detected an unusual administrative access from within the simulation and cuts Spectra off which will prevent him from breaching for the next 48 hours.
