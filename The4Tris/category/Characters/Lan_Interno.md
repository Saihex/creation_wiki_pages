He is a [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal) and originated from [The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life) as Bionic Creature turned into Brain Crystal prior to the [simulation phase](../Dimensions/the_simulation#origin-story). He's specialized into Strategy Planning and Chemistry with special skill of able to make right decisions quickly in a dire circumstances.

Regarding his relationship with [Silica](../Characters/Silica), [Lan was already soulmate to Silica from The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life#lan-meeting-silica).

In the simulation, Lan owns a company called **Triangle Electronics** *(abbreviated as TE)* specialized into making semiconductors, quantum compute processor, and [Hexatom Anomalous Crystal](../logic/Hexatom) products of any kind. Triangle Electronics is **the only company** that is allowed to produce Hexatom Anomalous Crystal by the **Universal Peacekeeper Organization** *(abbreviated as UPO)* which is an organization that put and enforce rules for all parties in the universe to keep peace and safety of everyone. This rule is enforced easily because to produce a **Hexatom Anomalous Crystal** you would need a [ExistTal](../logic/Hexatom#saihexatom-family) so it is impossible for other parties to produce it without stealing ExistTal from them. Lan was lucky for his company to get their hand on the ExistTal before other parties.
