# Sairo Darling

**Sairo Darling** is one of the four main characters in The 4Tris. She is a [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal) that is half Reality Bender Crystal which gives her reality bending capabilities. Unfortunately, [The Simulation](../Dimensions/the_simulation) prevents her from using all of her abilities due to the unfair advantage it gives her to complete the challenges. One of her power is [SaiHexatom manipulation](#saihexatom-manipulation) where she pretty much have atomic minions that do anything she wanted without limits at all.

While most of her abilities are locked some of them are still obviously unlocked and sometimes even the locked ones will either be temporarily unlocked or permanently unlocked. Her always unlocked ability is **SaiHexatom Inventory** where she can store anything she wanted in another dimension by simply holding it and teleport it to the dimension. Her wings are also always unlocked but her ability to fly sometimes locked depending on the situation. *Robots don't have to be and stay on one gender*

## SaiHexatom Manipulation
<img alt="SaiHexatom icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/characters/sairo/SaiHexatom.svg">

One of Sairo's power is **SaiHexatom Manipulation**. SaiHexatom is one of [Hexatom](../logic/Hexatom) type that only exists when commanded by a [Reality Bender Crystal](#the-other-half-reality-bender-crystal) which is part of Sairo's [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal). SaiHexatom will do anything to do Sairo's command such as scaling up or down, move Hexatom and atoms around it without actually moving, move around either at a speed or even faster than light, etc. It has infinite amount of strength but can shatter if Sairo wants it to.

SaiHexatom also forms Sairo's wings and [SaiSword](#saisword) blade by grouping together in a four-dimensional grid. In a grid SaiHexatom produces a [Voronoi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) texture which gives them a way to be differentiated between atoms and Hexatoms. The texture looked to be in a three-dimensional pattern relative to the world so when the Hexatom moves the texture moves too thus making it suspected to be a slice of two-dimensional view of a three-dimensional Voronoi structure. SaiHexatom also have a distinct color of between bright light-pink and dark light-pink. SaiHexatom surface can be soft or hard depending on what Sairo wants it to but usually mid-soft like a high-quality spring mattress.

## SaiSword

Sairo have a sword named **SaiSword** made by Silica for Sairo. The sword contains a Hexatom Relay Crystal which a crystal that can act as a electronic [relay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relay). However, Sairo's Reality Bender Crystal can link to these crystal and turned it into SaiHexatom Link Crystal. These crystal receive and sends signals as well energy from Sairo allowing her to control and power the device at her will. SaiSword blade is SaiHexatom and emits hexagon shaped particles. The blade can pass through objects without damaging it when Sairo wants it to so she can go around and prank her friends of "slicing" them while the sword just pass through them and do nothing to their body.

Since the signals and power of the sword is sourced from Sairo, the sword can only be used by Sairo. Sairo can make the crystal fly towards her at any speed from any direction and locations without limit it can even teleport to her!

## The other half (Reality Bender Crystal)

From [origin story](../Dimensions/the_simulation#origin-story). Even in [The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life), Sairo's crystal is half Reality Bender Crystal. This was because Crystali wanted to help Silica and Lan, her crystal being half the size of Brain Crystal typical size she decided to make her crystal half Brain Crystal. While Sairo is not Crystali, she still lives in her mind and can sometimes help Sairo during combat. This doesn't break the curse rule because she's not playing entirely but as a assistant which is allowed.

This does mean Spectra is soulmate to two individual just that the two are in the same body. Lucky gal.
