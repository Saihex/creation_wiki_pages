**Triangle Electronics** *(abbreviated as TE)* is a company founded and owned by [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno) that specialize into producing all sorts of electronics and quantum products such as Semiconductors, Quantum Compute Processor, and [Hexatom Anomalous Crystals](../logic/Hexatom)!

**Now let's be real,** Triangle Electronics only exists in [The Simulation](../Dimensions/the_simulation). This is **the only company** that is allowed to produce Hexatom Anomalous Crystal by the **Universal Peacekeeper Organization** *(abbreviated as UPO)*. This rule is enforced easily because Hexatoms required [ExistTal](../logic/Hexatom#saihexatom-family) in its production meaning if any other parties wanted to produce it they'll have to steal it from Lan's company.

Unknown to the **Universal Peacekeeper Organization** is [Lan Interno's](../Characters/Lan_Interno) plan to keep the universe save from all the evil. Lan have to make his own team of four to protect the universe without asking any help from any other parties as this will risk his peacekeeping operation.

## Logo designs

<img alt="Triangle Electronics Icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/non_char_entity/triangle_electronics/triangle_electronics_v2.svg">

The main logo is designed with three colors that are black, white, and grey `4c4c4c`. Placed on the right.

The other one is binary logo design which only consist of two colors that are black and white. This design is primarily used as physical logo on Triangle Electronics' machines or when it fits the digital UI design.

**There isn't any meaning to the logo** other than being a visual representation of the company name. Where the two triangles are to represent "Triangle" and the lightning icon represents "Electronics". But, the lightning symbol do somewhat represent the fact that Triangle Electronics produces high power equipment and computers both for the industry and residential however this was **NOT** planned.

[You can read about SiliCycle at Silica character page](../Characters/Silica#silicycle).
[Silica](../Characters/Silica) was actively stealing produces from **Triangle Electronics Mega Factory A1** while making her motorcycle (SiliCycle). This all went great thanks to her special skill but fell apart when Lan Interno asked her where she got all the components for it to which she fell begging for apologies because she can't lie to her own soulmate. As a loving soulmate he is, Lan forgive her and in fact helped her with finishing the motorcycle.

*This story might be sweet but please don't steal from your partner.*
