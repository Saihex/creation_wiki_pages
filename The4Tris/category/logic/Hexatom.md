title: Hexatom
description: Hexatom is a powerful type of atom that exists in The 4Tris universe. It is hexagon shaped, completely flat, have holds strong anomalous powers. Its stack structure is strongest in a shape of crystal thus making Anomalous Crystal.

# Hexatom
<img alt="Hexatom icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/logic/hexatom.svg">

Pronounced "Hex-sa-tom".

**Hexatom** is a type of atom that nearly similar in height and width but have no depth and somehow have a sphere collision around it with diameter equal to its height. It do have size differences depending on its properties. There is no way to observe inside of a Hexatom unlike atoms.

Hexatom only has one state that is solid and will never melt or evaporate no matter how high the temperature it is subjected to. The properties of Hexatom are defined during the creation process by manipulating how many white and black matter is collided and fused.

[Sairo Darling](../Characters/Sairo) whose [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal) is partially reality bender crystal have a ability to produce [SaiHexatom](#saihexatom-family). SaiHexatom is similar to Hexatom but drastically different because it exists upon her command and will do anything that she wanted it to do. Its sizes can change to whatever she wanted and its properties can change to whatever she wanted. This come to the cost of she will lose **mind power** which is different from the energy her crystal provide to the robot body. Basically, when her mind power is low she will become weak and she might went unconscious. However, low mind power but not too low to get her unconscious tends to lower her IQ temporarily and make her silly.

## Classification System
<img alt="Hexatom Classification Diagram" align="right" width="256" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/logic/hexatom_class.svg">

The possibilities of Hexatom combination are almost infinite making it hard to name every one of them. Because of this, Hexatom combination is classed with two values which are the White and Black matter mass that are fused to produce the Hexatom.

Sometimes, a combination is also given a nickname and a symbol if use of such combination is common enough.

<summary>Classification Diagram Usage</summary>

The usage of the Hexatom Classification Diagram is simple. Shape of the diagram varies depending on the content. For example, ThrustTal requires a rectangular shape diagram in order to fit its nickname and symbol.

The diagram have a title "Hexatom" to indicate this is an hexatom rather than elements or otherwise. A [NFPA 704](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704) is used to summarize the hazard such combination may cause.

Other than that, combinations with nicknames are often comes with a symbol and written as shown in the image. If the combination does not have a nickname nor a symbol then it is either won't be written or "N/A".

Lastly, separated by a line is the Black and White matter mass written in metric weight notation. For mass with decimals it is either written in **mixed fraction** or **standard form** to ensure precision.

## Hexatom Creation
Hexatom is created through a process named **White-Black Matter Collision** thus giving the machine doing the process **White-Black Matter Collider** as its name. The machine also contains a **Hexatom Anomalous Crystal** named **ExistTal** that makes the white and black matter collision actually produces Hexatom by emitting strange Hexatom Energy unreproducible by any mean other than powering the ExistTal. ExistTal cannot be recreated as it is part of [SaiHexatom Family](#saihexatom-family)

Hexatom creation process consumes a lot of energy at the rate of `20 GW/kg/matter`. The density of the matters will define the properties of the produced Hexatom and it will usually produce a perfect cube pure of that Hexatom ranging from `20 cubic centimeter` to `50 cubic centimeter` and it will slowly deforms to a more "stable" crystal structures as these crystal are not structurally stable in a cube shape. The reason remains unknown.

One of the Hexatom simple non-mixture recipe is **ThrustTal** which is a crystal that will accelerate itself towards the direction where electron enters it without needing any medium. Basically means it works inside vacuum. This crystal is created with `20kg` of white matter and `30kg` of black matter

The cube is then brought to **Hexatom cutting** machine where it will be cut to thin wafers similar to silicon wafers which then can be used to mix with other Hexatom wafers or elements for specific uses

## Using the Hexatom wafers
In a case of mixing it with other Hexatom wafer, the wafers will be stacked together and put under a vertical `70 billion pound` hydraulic press. Then, after reaching `60 billion pound` a constant `27,000V` `2,500A` which is `67,500,000W` will be provided from top to bottom of the wafer and the press will continue to `65 billion pound` mark where the wafer will start to fuse and the hydraulic press can stop increasing pressure and slowly decrease pressure as stack become shorter and shorter.

Fusing with other elements like steel or iron on the other hand will need same hydraulic press method just without the electrical current running through but put inside a perfect vacuum. They won't fuse but rather bond. When metals, semi-metal or even rocks are bond together with Hexatom; its melting and boiling temperature increased drastically and if it did melt the Hexatom will follow it keeping the bond. You basically have a molten metal that won't detach from itself despite being metal. Molten metal slime yay!

Hexatom will or not change the behavior and properties of the element. For example, [BCR Nerve Fiber](./Brain_Crystal.md#bcr-nerve-fiber) Hexatom does not effect the [DeltaTungstate-A1](./Brain_Crystal.md#deltatungstate-a1) property nor behavior and only act as a wire in it to transmit and receive signals

## Depletion
Hexatoms do deplete over time either by using it or just existing. Age of Hexatom varies type to type and how it is being used. Hexatom will show degrade over its lifespan in several ways such as poor performance, color change, lose weight, etc. Once Hexatom is completely depleted it can be melted although melting it simply vaporize it from existence. Basically no waste!

## SaiHexatom Family
<img alt="SaiHexatom Icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/characters/sairo/SaiHexatom.svg">

**SaiHexatom** is a Hexatom created upon Sairo's power through [SaiHexatom Manipulation](../Characters/Sairo#saihexatom-manipulation). **SaiHexatom Family** cannot be replicated by any means and only one instance of the crystal exists as well it will **never** deplete. All SaiHexatom family instances cannot be break apart as it have virtually infinite amount of strength. **SaiHexatom Family** will do anything so at least one individual can reach it like if you were to throw one into a black hole the crystal will blow up the black hole and after everything cooled the crystal remains intact without any damage. Although, it doesn't care about distance and only path so even if it is 100 lightyears away from nearest individual it will not do anything as path to it exists.

Here are known **SaiHexatom Family Instances**
- **SaiHexatom**
  - Exists upon Sairo's command.
- **Reality Bender Crystal**
  - Capable of bending reality and control SaiHexatoms. Part of Sairo's Brain Crystal
- **ExistTal**
  - Used to create Hexatom Anomalous Crystals.
- **Crystal of Fairness**
  - Capable of bending reality to give the owner of the crystal unfair advantages.
