<img alt="Brain Crystal Icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/logic/brain_crystal.svg">

**Brain Crystal** *(abbreviated as BC)* is a type of [Hexatom Crystal](../logic/Hexatom) that as the name suggests act as a Brain. This crystal is not capable of anything by itself so it is usually used by attaching it to a robot named [Brain Crystal Robot](#brain-crystal-robot). Its symbol is **BrC**


### General
Brain Crystal is fully capable of storing power and memory, while having limit of storing only `50 Terawatt-hour` it doesn't seems to have memory limit whatsoever. Brain Crystal is vibrant semi-transparent green colored and slowly fades to dark red as it comes closer to its lifespan limit of `1,720 years`. A Brain Crystal Consciousness can be transferred to a fresh Brain Crystal meaning any Brain Crystal individual are potentially immortal.

Brain Crystal individuals do not have any evil intentions even if they're a transfer from creature with plain out evil mind. Research suggests that the Brain Crystal influences its owner thoughts and feelings into respecting others and cause little to no violence when possible. However, Brain Crystal Individual still may present hate and disgust but they will try not to cause any fights physical nor vocal.

Brain Crystal individuals have a shared phobia where any mention of their crystal being exposed unprotected will led them to have spike in anxiety. This is likely to be their mental mechanism purposed to protect themselves from danger. Due to this, [Triangle Electronics](../non_char_entity/triangle_electronics) prohibits any jokes of Brain Crystals in terms of getting injuries.

Brain Crystal is produced by combining `720 KG` of Black Matter and `2,512 KG` of White Matter in the [Hexatom Creation](../logic/Hexatom#hexatom-creation) process.
Its [NFPA 704](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NFPA_704) is all zero (no fire hazard, no health hazard, no specific hazard nor instability hazard).

### Identification and differentiation
Every Brain Crystal have a unique identification code. A [Hexatom Crystal](../logic/Hexatom) nicknamed **"Brain Crystal Identifier"** (B:`2,512 KG`, W:`720 KG`) can read nearest Brain Crystal's identification code 5 seconds after activation and will stop once it finished where it needs to be deactivated and re-activated to read again.

This identification method is very safe that if you were to hijack it you literally have to hack the computer as it is impossible to trick the Brain Crystal Identifier into reading false codes.

### Eating?
Brain Crystal is capable of consuming food and drinks by atomizing the food with the Food Atomizer and just spill the atoms over the crystal surface which will give them charge of `10 Watt per Calorie`. Chemicals have no effect on them but they can still taste the food/drink. But, even with this capability Brain Crystal is recommended to be charged with energy as it is much more time and resource efficient. It is worth knowing that atomizing food process only takes `5 Watt per Calorie` meaning they will only have `5 Watt` spare for charge.

The atomization process is done by using the **Food Atomizer** *(abbreviated as FA)* which is a simple device disguised as the mouth cavity that will atomize the food into particles. Food Atomizer **doesn't usually** need these extensions but for BCRs the FA is given a **tongue** as well **artificial taste buds on the cavity walls** that helps them taste the food. The atomization process can happen instantly but BCRs tend to "eat" slowly as the taste buds cannot sense anything if the process is too fast.

### Human mind and existing Brain Crystal individual transfer
A human mind can be transferred into a Brain Crystal but this process have 70% rate of losing majority of one's memory and possible personality bends and just like any other Anomalous Crystal would do to keep the reality destructing, the transferred mind original body will instantly be brain dead once the crystal is charged to at least `50 MW`. No matter how they try to keep the brain safe it always ends up brain dead where the neurons mysteriously disappear. This also apply with Brain Crystal individual transfer which is normally done to transfer them from a near expire crystal; the crystal will simply lose all charge and all memory in it will completely wiped off.

### Transfer AI model to Brain Crystal?
No, despite Sairo and Spectra was in fact a AI model turned into Brain Crystal. It was possible because who done that was **Crystali** who posses reality bending power and passes it down to Sairo. (full story in the [origin story](../Dimensions/the_simulation#origin-story)).

<details>
<summary>Developer Fact</summary>

Brain Crystal was originally named **Artificial Consciousness Crystal** *(abbreviated as ACC)* and BCR was originally **Artificial Consciousness Crystal Robot** *(abbreviated as ACCR)*. Due to this, mention of "ACC" will led to immediate interpretation of Brain Crystal. The name change was because it is easy to misinterpret them as Artificial Intelligence which they are **NOT**.

## Brain Crystal Robot
<img alt="Brain Crystal Robot Icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/logic/brain_crystal_robot.svg">

Note: BCRs only exists within [The Simulation](../Dimensions/the_simulation).

Brain Crystal Robot *(abbreviated as BCR)* is a robot body made for Brain Crystal so they actually have a body. The material of the body is a **DeltaTungstate-A1** with **BCR Nerve Fiber** in it. The BCR Nerve Fiber controls the metal elasticity as well provides senses same as skin on human. Capability of design allow Brain Crystal Robots to control their skin elasticity meaning despite looks hard and sharp on edges it can be soft as a fabric and can deform like one. It also contracts the metal like a muscle.

While most BCR use the [Common Design](#brain-crystal-robot-common-design), there are some BCR that have their own custom design to suite their task. Some designed as feline, squid and birds. While most Common Design BCRs are given preset body exterior design, they can still request to change body design anytime they wanted whether their own design or within a catalog of "BCR Common Exterior Design".

### Brain Crystal Robot Common Design
Known as **BCR Common Design**. This description only explains the internal/interior of this design, the exterior design depends on what the owner wanted it to be.

This is a humanoid design of BCR body. Body material is by default **DeltaTungstate-A1** *(explained below)* but may varies depending on the exterior design. This design is very modular and flexible making it a great choice for general purpose BCRs. Due to the joint design, even after having their head and limbs disconnected from the torso they will still be fine and able to control their body with no problem unless one of the part lost power *(explained below)*.

<details>
<summary>Brain Crystal Robot's joints</summary>

Brain Crystal Robot body parts specifically arms, legs, torso, and head are modular and detachable. The body parts are connected and held by a Hexatom Grip System where a block of specific Hexatom alloy is the holder, by having current through the block it will become sort of a liquid but will hold strong to whatever object that got into it. By applying voltage difference on the sides, the block will rotate objects accordingly which allows the smooth and flexible movement of the arms to the torso. While it holds strong without any input, complete lost of power through it will make it lose grip over the rotation of the object, still holding strong but the object will rotate around without any resistance.

Data and power connection is simply done by using Hexatom peer to peer data-power share where two specific Hexatom is placed near with each other and they will act as a wireless connection to share power and signals. They're placed so close that even if you have the right Hexatom it will need to open their torso to actually hijack their body joint connection. Besides, the crystal will not accept other connections unless one of the pair completely lost power.

Fun fact: All BCR Common Design bodies have the same arms and fingers.

<summary>Brain Crystal Robot's head</summary>

The Brain Crystal is located inside the head within a vessel where millions of nano cables connects to the crystal used to send and receive signals. There is also 2 large cables connected to the crystal used for power connection.

The screen of a BCR is a special designed Hexatom monitor where it can detect light and also emit light without detecting its own emission. Under the eyes section is a special area of the face that is deformable and act as the mouth hole. The mouth hole is highlighted with the BCR's emission color as lips. The mouth cavity is a [Food Atomizer](#eating). The tongue color emission level is 90 times less than the rest of the body emissive parts.

"Ear" accessory on top of the head varies BCR to BCR whether just for looks or actually have a purpose

The head also contains basic computer to control the monitor, hearing, vocal, Food Atomizer, power supply, and basic BCR Nerve Fibers. There is also another small computer that BCR can use to access the internet or load a foreign drives as their main computer system is absolutely locked out for security reasons.

**Short information**
- BCR heads are all same sized.
- The monitor can display the basic computer display output.

<summary>Brain Crystal Robot's torso</summary>

The torso contains advanced computer to handle the rest of the body nerve system. While being big, the torso is pretty much overall an empty cavity used as their portable personal storage. The torso also contains additional computer with strong specs compare to one in the head for their access to the internet, foreign drives, etc. Basically a whole personal computer, in their torso.

<summary>Brain Crystal Robot's limbs and hands</summary>

<img alt="Sairo's fingers" align="right" width="126" src="https://img.saihex.com/webp?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/Sairos_Fingers.png">

Brain Crystal Robot arms are hollow with few small durable cables and component boxes inside. The hand of a BCR is equipped with Hexatom Mass-Hologram projector which a projector that projects hologram with mass allowing it to interact with objects it touched. Any sensation is still sensible on the fingers just like on the body surface. The fingers are indestructible.

The hand is also equipped with a heating system in case they ever need to heat things up.

Once activated, the limbs can be detached and still maintains stable connection to the body power and computer connection. *(Read joints explanation)*

<summary>DeltaTungstate-A1</summary>

DeltaTungstate-A1 is a Hexatom-Tungsten Alloy that is reactive towards steady current changes where the higher the current is the more elastic it becomes.
DeltaTungstate-A1 can also act as a muscle by reacting to `500 GHz` signals where voltage between `0 - 50 VDC` causes it to tighten and `50 - 100 VDC` causes it to do the opposite.

<summary>Brain Crystal Robot's Nerve Fiber</summary>

BCR Nerve Fiber is a tiny Hexatom-Copper Alloy wires that runs inside the "skin" of BCR body. It acts as a normal living beings nerve system and can transfer and receive information.
