# Naming System
<img alt="Naming System Icon" align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/logic/naming_system.svg">

Unlike real life naming system where it is often the end of the name is the family name like "Stefon **Armbig**" and front can be rank such as "**Captain** Illusion". **Naming System** within the 4Tris universe is a little bit different.

This goes back to [Lan Interno's](../Characters/Lan_Interno) original civilization from [The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life) where they will name their citizenry with last name as their rank. Citizenry who have rank and have three names often indicates that the middle name is their family name. Family names cannot be exactly or sound the same as to any valid ranks within the civilization.

Ranks are often used only to indicate their specialty and trust within the civilization which means they can do works outside of their rank if given permission to or in a dire situation where they must do it to protect themselves with few exceptions such as commanded Fiscal's execution order.

| rank | role |
| ---- | ---- |
| Interno | Researcher and protector |
| Darling | Interno assistant |
| Nebula | Professors (PhD of any kind) |
| Fractal | Interno commander |
| Fiscal | Civilization Manager (limited time rank) |

In the simulation, this name system is used as the universal naming system meaning all interstellar must have support for this naming system. This system is governed by **Universal Peacekeeper Organization (UPO)** and [Triangle Electronics](../non_char_entity/triangle_electronics).
