**The 4Tris** is a franchise created by [IskandarAlex2](https://twitter.com/Alex2Iskandar). This franchise has 4 main characters which are **Sairo, Spectra, Silica, and Lan Interno**. They all are [Brain Crystal Robot](./logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot)  *(Not to be confused with Artificial Intelligence; They're NOT AI, please read wiki about BCR)*.

### Iskyverse
The franchise falls under **Iskyverse** which a universe for IskandarAlex2's original creations where unit of scale is **Iskyverse Unit** *(abbreviated as IU)*. Iskyverse Unit ratio to centimeter for real life scale *(IU : CM)* is `1 : 293/6096`. Iskyverse Unit ratio can also be simplified with foot *(IU : Foot)* `14.65 : 10` or with centimeter *(IU : CM)* `14.65 : 304.8`

Developer fact: `1 IU` is equal to `1 m` in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) on default settings, Sairo model was used for Iskyverse Unit where she is `14.65 IU` tall which is `10 foot` from head to foot excluding ears

### Reality Information
The 4Tris occurs firstly in the real world with science fiction technology and little bit of magic. There is this one thing called **Anomaly Crystals (AC)** which are crystal formed by not atoms but **Hexatoms**, these crystals hold special properties where depending on the Hexatom bonds with other Hexatom and their types. While they're very reproducible with **White-Black Matter Collider** there can only be finite amount of Hexatoms which was estimated to be around `10^50` and if any more were attempted to be created the process will simply return no Hexatom whatsoever. Hexatom will wear off literally from existence but it usually takes a long time.

Most Anomaly Crystals are replicable but there is one that is not which is named **Reality Bender Crystal**, this crystal can bend the reality to whatever the controller desire. But this crystal is very hard to find and it seems to be impossible to control *as if it is sentient*.
