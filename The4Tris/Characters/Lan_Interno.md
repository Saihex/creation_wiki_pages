He is a [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal) and originated from The 4Tris real life as Bionic Creature turned into Brain Crystal prior to the simulation phase. He's specialized into Strategy Planning and Chemistry with special skill of able to make right decisions quickly in a dire circumstances.

Regarding his relationship with [Silica](../Characters/Silica), [Lan was already soulmate to Silica from The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life#lan-meeting-silica).

## Triangle Electronics and Hexatoms
In the simulation, Lan owns a company called **Triangle Electronics** *(abbreviated as TE)* specialized into making semiconductors, quantum compute processor, and [Hexatom Anomalous Crystal](../logic/Hexatom) products of any kind. Triangle Electronics is **the only company** that is allowed to produce Hexatom Anomalous Crystal by the **Universal Peacekeeper Organization** *(abbreviated as UPO)* which is an organization that put and enforce rules for all parties in the universe to keep peace and safety of everyone. This rule is enforced easily because to produce a **Hexatom Anomalous Crystal** you would need a [ExistTal](../logic/Hexatom#saihexatom-family) so it is impossible for other parties to produce it without stealing ExistTal from them. Lan was lucky for his company to get their hand on the ExistTal before other parties.
