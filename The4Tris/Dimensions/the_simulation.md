# The Simulation
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/svg_png?src=wiki_exclusive/The4Tris/page_icon/dimensions/the_simulation/the_simulation.svg">

**The Simulation** is the dimension after [The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life). [Brain Crystal Robot](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot) exists in this dimension. The Simulation is Lan's simulation that's running on his **Hexatom Ultra Quantum Computer** in [The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life). The four main characters [Silica](../Characters/Silica), [Spectra](../Characters/Spectra), [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo), and [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno) are real Brain Crystals attached to the computer simulation.

The simulation pre-simulate the first 200 trillion years of the simulation in about 7 days and 22 hours which then it will run at real time and allow [Silica](../Characters/Silica), [Spectra](../Characters/Spectra), [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo), and [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno) to control their body and move around. During the pre-simulation process, the four were in a room inside their [BCR](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot) body which they hang out and get to know each other so they won't waste any time when they get into the simulation.

## Origin Story
**The 4Tris Real Life** dimension was dying because of heat death, many stars were collapsing leaving red dwarfs behind. Silica helped Lan cruise within the empty void of space to find radioactive materials to be used as the ship's fuel. After `7,500 years` of cruising and still keeping it up together, they found something that would change their life forever. A **Reality Bender Crystal (RBC)**. They brought the crystal into their ship and tried to get it to wake up. The RBC woke up by forming a humanoid female body around the crystal and was shocked as it never thought anyone would think it actually had a consciousness but quickly answered its own thought by seeing Silica's [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal) inside a **Brain Crystal Computer Attachment Capsule** on the ship control panel. The RBC introduced herself as **Crystali** and they can call her with **She/Her** pronoun.

Crystali explains that she's been keeping the universe away from heat death for millions of years using her powers which all went great. Until one day, a fateful meeting with another greedy RBC who she refers as **Pentana** from another universe cursed her and locked her from using her powers. Pentana said that to get the curse to break Crystali will have to get an individual or a group into a simulation where they will have to beat a predefined challenges Pentana gave Crystali in a form of `20 Petabyte` text file within a **StorTal** which a digital memory storage [Hexatom Anomalous Crystal](../logic/Hexatom) that is capable of storing `7 Petabyte per 3 cubic centimeter`.

Crystali said that she have put 20 other groups in but all of them failed and die. Silica and Lan talked to each other for 5 seconds before telling Crystali they will risk it and bring her to the room where Lan put his simulation computer. Crystali was shocked to see such a powerful computer but explains his simulation design isn't for realism and more cartoony version of [The 4Tris Real Life](../Dimensions/real_life). Crystali worried that it would break the curse rule but after running the software within the **StorTal** given by Pentana for checking if the simulation is eligible or not it passed which relief them. **Lan Interno** explains that the simulation is currently about two Brain Crystal Robots who are trying to revive peace named [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo) and [Spectra](../Characters/Spectra). While Spectra is normal Brain Crystal, Sairo is half Reality Bender Crystal which is basically Crystali. Before Crystali could say anything, the software that checks the simulation gave a tip which explains that Crystali can help them by fusing herself with a Brain Crystal for Sairo, she won't be able to play completely but can assist Sairo.

This gave Crystali an idea to which she created two Brain Crystals, one is Spectra's and another is Sairo's fused with her Crystal. She explains that her crystal is half the size of a Brain Crystal so she can be part of Sairo. Crystali also created another Brain Crystal for Lan where she explains once the crystal is activated his body will become brain dead instantly. Lan and Silica agreed. Lan take all the three crystal and Silica's crystal then attach it all to the simulation computer. The simulation software checker runs a check again and see everything met the rules and prompt a start button.

Right before Lan went into decomposition containment vessel he asked Crystali what about the ship to which she responded that while they're in the simulation magical Hexatom energy will maintain the ship power and structure throughout the simulation. Lan continued to go into the decomposition containment vessel and asked Crystali to press the button. Crystali pressed the button and Lan drop dead to the floor of the vessel and Crystali fizzles out.

## Their goal within the simulation
Their mission inside the simulation is to take all 8 stolen [SaiHexatom Family](../logic/Hexatom#saihexatom-family) crystals that will be used to activate a very powerful machine that breaks any simulation medium. This will break Crystali's curse and allow her to fix the universe.
