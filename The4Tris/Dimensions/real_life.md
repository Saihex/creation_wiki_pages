**The 4Tris Real Life** is the dimension where [Silica](../Characters/Silica) and [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno) originated from. **Lan Interno** was created as Bionic Creature whose job is to travel far into interstellar space for resources and research planets while **Silica** was a [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal) whose job is to assist travelers on their job for lifetime.

In this dimension, [Hexatom](../logic/Hexatom) was a scarce resource and the company that was responsible for producing them have trouble of kept being attacked because enemies wanted to make it for themselves despite that is a universal crime. Meanwhile, [Brain Crystal Robot](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot) does not exists at all and only the [Brain Crystal](../logic/Brain_Crystal).

## The Cruel World
**The 4Tris Real Life** is a cruel dimension. All parties in the interstellar are fighting and having war with each other because of greed. [Lan](../Characters/Lan_Interno) was lucky to be made by a party that was made to stop the interstellar pirates and revive peace. When [Lan](../Characters/Lan_Interno) was on his mission, he stopped `720` interstellar pirates and saved `1,257` small parties who kept being attacked by the pirates. He was praised as **Peace boy** alongside his assistant [Silica](../Characters/Silica) who was praised as **Peace girl**.

Unfortunately, all the parties that [Lan](../Characters/Lan_Interno) saved suddenly disappeared and stopped contacting him. [Silica](../Characters/Silica) suggest him that it is better to not check on them because they're probably attacked and deleted all contacts with them to protect them.

## Lan meeting Silica
After Lan finished his training and passed all test he was sent to his lifetime job of going out and research planets. He was given a ship and a Brain Crystal named **Silica** as his assistant that attach to the ship computer. **At first** Silica wasn't happy and worried because all of her other Brain Crystal friends said that their commander are very bad in so many ways so Silica was trying to make Lan hate her that he will replace her with another Brain Crystal.

When Silica tried to make Lan get annoyed he often just forgive her which slowly shifted her perception towards Lan but she often just brush it off thinking it's his way of trying to lure her into him. One day, Silica decided to check Lan's room while he's outside the ship and way shocked to see how clean his room thinking "maybe not all boys are messy". She looked at his desk and found his diary which make she felt weird because she thought boys never kept a diary. She decided to read it despite knowing that's wrong and all in it is Lan talking about how cute Silica is and even say that it felt wrong for him to feel that way because that's quite a pervert activity. This instantly shifted Silica into liking him knowing he's not any kind of normal boys.

While Lan was eating dinner, Silica joined Lan which then he greets Silica in the most respectful voice tone which caused Silica to reach the highest girly feelings she ever had. Ever since that, Silica was getting closer and closer to Lan and eventually they become soulmates.
