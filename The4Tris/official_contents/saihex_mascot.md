# Saihex Studios' Mascot
<img align="right" width="200" src="https://img.saihex.com/saihex.svg">

**YES!**. The 4Tris is in fact Saihex Studios' mascot. In fact, Saihex Studios' logo color is because of [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo) as well the choice of hexagon shape (her pupils).
During the time this page is being written we have no any content on our social media accounts to advertise or promote but we planned to use **The 4Tris** main characters as well probably one or two background characters to give the content more life and the true color of our intentions. Like our main website said; we prioritize transparency.

Despite this, The 4Tris main characters are under [BY-NC-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) as is for now since we don't really need a trademark right now. In a case we do a trademark however, any creative contents related to **The 4Tris main characters** created prior to the trademark registration will **NOT** cause the creator of the creative content into legal trouble. After all, we love to see our community thrive and build upon our creations! All we ask is a little credit ðŸ˜Š

The 4Tris also appears on our website error pages for `404` error *(On the right)* and `500` *(On the left)* error. In this wiki page, the images is loaded at their original resolution inside our server of `1000 x 1000` pixels but in the error page it will be downscaled to `512 x 512` to improve network performance and load the image faster since you're not going to see them very often especially `500` error.
