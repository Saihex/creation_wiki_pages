**The 4Tris: Unreal** is a game of **The 4Tris** franchise. It is a lore-driven game and currently being developed inside [Unreal Engine 5.3](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5). The game is simply about [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo), [Silica](../Characters/Silica), [Spectra](../Characters/Spectra), and [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno) just got into [The Simulation](../Dimensions/the_simulation) and off to complete [their first mission of taking Crystal of Fairness](#their-mission). The game is semi-story mode where players can still move around but will have to "play" the story. We are planning to add quite a lot of cut scene gameplay where players have to do key combinations or mouse movement in order to make actions.

Because this game story takes place `two years` after they got into the simulation [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo) and [Spectra](../Characters/Spectra) are still anxious knowing they're in a simulation and if they failed their missions they'll be gone forever. Not long after that, they managed cope with the feelings and focus on their task through help from [Silica](../Characters/Silica) and [Lan Interno](../Characters/Lan_Interno).

The choice of name is **NOT** because the game is being developed inside [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/unreal-engine-5) but rather because story based they just got into the simulation, even for [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo) and [Spectra](../Characters/Spectra) that just exists and woke up. The simulation cartoony graphics and physics feels **Unreal**.

## Their mission and sub-stories
While their overall mission in [The Simulation](../Dimensions/the_simulation#their-goal-within-the-simulation) is to take back 8 [SaiHexatom Family](../logic/Hexatom#saihexatom-family) crystals, in **The 4Tris: Unreal** is only the story of them taking back [Crystal of Fairness](../Dimensions/the_simulation#their-goal-within-the-simulation). **Other than that,** this game also contains few sub-stories listed below

- **Spectra's and Sairo's existential crisis**
  - Lan Interno and Silica helped Spectra and Sairo to understand their existence and why they are created for a reason.
- **Sairo's trouble with her powers**
  - Since Sairo is mostly in control of the movement and actions, she have trouble of communicating with [Crystali](../Dimensions/the_simulation#origin-story) quickly in order to use her powers. Sairo completely learn how to communicate with Crystali without any verbal or motion signals and only mind to mind.
