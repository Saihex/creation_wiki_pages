# The 4Tris' Revolution
The 4Tris beings with [Sairo](../Characters/Sairo). Her name was firstly spelled `SAIRo` as abbreviation for **Smart Artificial Intelligence Robot** and yes she started as an AI Robot rather than [BCR](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot) that she currently is.

## Sairo's Revolution
Sairo went through multiple iterations and was created as early as when Saihex Studios was **Starsdust Studios**.

### Sairo V1

**Sairo V1** was designed by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) back in `2022`. Her body is detached and held together by strong electromagnets. She doesn't have any hands and her face is entirely static images with no procedural graphics. The simple design both visual and technical was because of Isk's knowledge limit of barely knowing proper weight painting, texture baking, shader math, etc.

This version was created for **SAIRo** game which has been cancelled long ago. Although, four musics for it was already composed by [Vandoorea](https://www.youtube.com/@Vandoorea) that can be found in a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNVE8lNMMe2GBo_4RDFaTb44uB-nv5cDK). These musics are planned to be used in [The 4Tris: Unreal](../official_contents/The4Tris_Unreal) as a form of gratitude for contributing with us.

### Sairo V2-3

*V1 image contains Spectra V1 which won't be discussed.*

**Sairo V2** and **Sairo V3** was designed by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) back in early `2023`. Her body is connected by electromagnet ball-socket joints. Simple procedural shader is already implemented on her face for eyes. The rise of dual color design came up on `V3` with an uneven distribution around her body.

### Sairo V4

**Sairo V4** was designed by [IskandarAlex2](https://github.com/IskandarAlex2) back in early `2024`. Anatomy design is explain in [BCR page](../logic/Brain_Crystal#brain-crystal-robot). We decided to use smooth arm and legs to make her look more appealing and use more female-ly waist design as well chest to better explain her personality in visual form.
